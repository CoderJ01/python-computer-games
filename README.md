# Python Computer Games

## Purpose
This repository showcases games created using the Python programming language. The creation of these games help instill and reinforce basic Python concepts. Anyone who wants to learn Python should purchase "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" by Al Sweigart. Be sure to not copy and paste the code from a site you find online. Deligently type the code from the book so that you can more effectively absorb the concepts. Good luck!
