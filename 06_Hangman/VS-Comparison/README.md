# Python Dubugger Limitation

When utilizing the Python code editor, a greater emphasis should be placed on looking for typos. For example, as the images convey, a simple typo can effect the output of the code. If the parameter 'missedLetters' is spelled as 'misssedLetters', then the code still runs. However, the incorrectly-guessed letters will not dispaly on the code output.

Anyone accustomed to utilizing VS Code knows that said code editor would automatically catch that sort of error. Squiggly lines would appear under the mispelled word. Yet, the Python dubugger failed to spot the mistake.
