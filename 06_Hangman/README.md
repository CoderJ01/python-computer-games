# Hangman

## Purpose
The classic game "Hangman" involves two players. Player A comes up with a secret word. Player B attempts to guess each letter of the word. If Player B guesses a wrong letter, then a body part of a stick figure is drawn on the hanger. This particular program is based on the game version for which the following body parts are used: head, torso, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg. Thus, for this particular variation, Player B has six chances to guess a wrong letter. If all the chances are used, then Player B loses the game. 

In this case, Player A is the computer and Player B is the user.
