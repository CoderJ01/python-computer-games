# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Purpose
"Tic-Tac-Toe" is a classic game based on a square with nine sections; three rows, three columns. It is played by two players. Player A (computer) plays marks a circle in one of the spots. Player B (user) marks an X in another spot. The player who places three marks on a row, column or diagonal first wins the game.

NOTE: From this point on, I'll be utilizing the Python extension for VS code.
